The MERN stack consists of four main technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, which together create a seamless development process.
Each technology in the stack provides a comprehensive framework for developers, making web application development smoother and more manageable.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to index and scale.
Express is a backend framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side code and supports middleware, enhancing code efficiency.
React is a frontend library that builds user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, using components and a virtual DOM for better performance.
Lastly, Node.js allows JavaScript code to run on the server side, offering a fast and scalable runtime environment.
Each of these technologies contributes significantly to the development of robust and scalable web applications.
