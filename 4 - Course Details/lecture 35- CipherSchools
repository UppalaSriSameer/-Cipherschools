In this lecture we have learned about the difference between Sql and NoSql

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, like MySQL and PostgreSQL,
use a relational model with structured schemas and tables to store data,
making them ideal for applications requiring complex queries and
transactions with ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
They use SQL for defining and manipulating data. In contrast, NoSQL databases,
such as MongoDB and Cassandra, are designed for more flexible, scalable storage,
often using a document, key-value, column-family, or graph-based model.
NoSQL databases excel in handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data,
providing high availability and horizontal scaling, but typically offer weaker consistency
guarantees compared to traditional SQL databases.
